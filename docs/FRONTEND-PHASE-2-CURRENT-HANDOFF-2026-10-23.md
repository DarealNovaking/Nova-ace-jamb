# Frontend Phase 2 — Current Handoff (2026-10-23)

## Scope
Current user-approved task is Frontend Phase 2 closeout. Do not drift to catalogue ingestion or infer a formal Phase 3 milestone.

## Repository
- Repository: `DarealNovaking/Nova-ace-jamb`
- Branch: `main`
- HEAD observed: `0cf9fe0aae55a5f7a907a09503dc239d63d89598`

## Verified
- GitHub Actions Verify run [39810652243](https://github.com/DarealNovaking/Nova-ace-jamb/actions/runs/39810652243), attempt 2, completed successfully.
- Jobs `verify` and `utme-subject-choice-migration` passed.
- Reported checks passed: Node tests, Deno checks for `ibass-catalog-stage` and `catalog-import`, `npm run typecheck`, `npm run build`, UTME subject-choice SQL test, and syllabus-publication visibility SQL test.

## Blocked / unverified
- E2E run [39810652048](https://github.com/DarealNovaking/Nova-ace-jamb/actions/runs/39810652048), job [119935661138](https://github.com/DarealNovaking/Nova-ace-jamb/actions/runs/39810652048/job/119935661138), concluded failure before any steps ran. Job details show `steps: []`, no assigned runner ID/name, and no Playwright output. This is a job-start/runner failure, **not evidence of a Playwright assertion failure**.
- The exact start failure reason remains unconfirmed. The user previously reported a GitHub Actions billing/spending-limit restriction; verify whether it still applies rather than assuming it is the confirmed cause for this run.
- Playwright desktop/mobile flows and deployed acceptance were not executed in this investigation.
- Payments, referral qualification/rewards, grounded AI retrieval, audio delivery and notification scheduling/delivery must remain unverified unless backed by server contracts and end-to-end evidence.

## Changes in this handoff update
- Documentation only. No application code, database rows, migrations, workflow files or deployment changed.
- The master handoff and checkpoint have extensive historical logs; this file is the concise current pointer and does not replace that history.

## Exact next action
Inspect the E2E job annotations/start reason at the job link above. When a runner is available, execute the existing E2E suite against the current `main` SHA; review reports and verify desktop/mobile navigation, student settings, admin authorization and PWA shell. Fix only reproducible defects, then record run IDs/results in the master handoff, continuity checkpoint and frontend batch log. Phase 2 remains OPEN until that evidence is recorded or the owner explicitly accepts documented exceptions.

## Anti-drift notes
- Do not reopen resolved admin/student routing without new evidence.
- Do not re-upload the already-imported 791-institution workbook without fresh evidence it is missing.
- Do not claim Playwright passed.
- Do not treat a job that never ran test steps as a test assertion failure.


## E2E execution results and Phase 2 defect triage — 2026-10-23
- Retried the existing E2E job, run [39810652048](https://github.com/DarealNovaking/Nova-ace-jamb/actions/runs/39810652048), job ID `120401891161`. Runner started successfully and completed dependency install, `npm run typecheck`, `npm run build`, and Playwright browser installation.
- Typecheck: PASS. Build: PASS, with existing Vite warning that the minified JS chunk is ~916 kB (>500 kB recommendation). Dependency install reported 8 npm audit vulnerabilities (2 moderate, 6 high); no automatic dependency changes made.
- Playwright: FAIL — 58 passed, 4 failed across desktop Chromium and mobile Chromium. Failures are two tests repeated across both projects:
  1. `tests/e2e/smoke.spec.ts:589`, admin operations readiness: expects dynamic detail text `Grounded student AI stays disabled` before explicitly waiting for metrics loading to finish. The component renders this detail only when count is exactly zero; the test currently checks a static detail before checking the dynamic one. Inspect the final metric state and make the assertion wait for a stable readiness condition rather than weakening the safety expectation.
  2. `tests/e2e/smoke.spec.ts:941`, first-use settings regression: expected the dashboard greeting but it never rendered in this test fixture. The test layers route handlers over `mockPreparedStudent`, returning a 406/PGRST116 for missing preferences and overriding profile writes. The service’s `getStudentPreferences()` uses `.maybeSingle()`, so the fixture's 406 response may not accurately represent the zero-row response; inspect trace/error context and fix the mock contract or the actual dashboard failure based on evidence. Do not blindly change production logic.
- Artifacts uploaded: [Playwright test artifacts](https://github.com/DarealNovaking/Nova-ace-jamb/actions/runs/39810652048/artifacts/12500570258). The job did execute real browser tests; the prior “no steps ran” record describes the pre-retry attempt only. Keep both historical facts, and treat this latest attempt as the current evidence.
- This run checked out source SHA `0cf9fe0aae55a5f7a907a09503dc239d63d89598`; documentation commits added after that SHA were not included in the tested source snapshot. Refresh current `main` and rerun after any test/code changes.
- Phase 2 remains OPEN. Next action: inspect the two failing tests’ Playwright traces/context, correct the deterministic test/fixture issue or reproducible app defect, then rerun E2E on latest `main`. After a clean suite, complete deployed student/admin/mobile acceptance. No source code, database, migration, workflow, or deployment was changed during this triage.


## Frontend Phase 2 E2E defect fixes — 2026-10-23

- Reconciled current main before edits: previous runner-backed Playwright run on source SHA `0cf9fe0aae55a5f7a907a09503dc239d63d89598` had 58 passed / 4 failed (the same two failures repeated on desktop and mobile). Retrieved the uploaded Playwright artifact, but did not verify its `error-context.md` files or trace network snapshots; do not treat artifact-level diagnosis as confirmed.
- Admin readiness failure: the test asserted a metric-dependent detail before asynchronous count queries settled; the mocked HEAD responses also did not expose `content-range`. Updated `tests/e2e/smoke.spec.ts` to expose the count headers and wait for the Refresh status button to become enabled before asserting the zero-count state.
- First-use preferences regression failure: the test returned a synthetic PostgREST 406/PGRST116 for a `.maybeSingle()` GET, which did not accurately model the empty-row response for this mocked client contract. Updated the isolated fixture to return HTTP 200 with an empty JSON array for zero rows; all Supabase traffic remains intercepted and no production data is used.
- Safety correction: `src/components/AdminOperationsOverview.tsx` now explicitly says student AI stays disabled when rights-cleared knowledge-source readiness is unavailable, rather than implying active approved sources when the metric is unknown.
- Commits: `bd7ac99d9b24cd475d4826579c00992db223857d` (fixtures), `412d4ecda826f146e5754c044bedcd93c87af18f` (safe unknown-state copy), `922633452c6c5153386406694709762ef6287459` (wait for settled admin metric state). Current source HEAD at documentation time: `922633452c6c5153386406694709762ef6287459`.
- Verification after these fixes: NOT YET RUN. The earlier run's typecheck/build passed but the E2E suite failed; those results do not verify these new commits. No local test runner is available through this GitHub-only editing path, and no new runner result has yet been retrieved. No database, migration, production data, or deployment changes were made.
- Exact next action: retrieve current-main Verify and ACE JAMB E2E results for the latest commit; if Actions runs have not started, inspect current workflow status/runner availability and wait for a real runner-backed execution. Fix only reproducible failures, then refresh this record and the checkpoint. Phase 2 remains OPEN.


## Follow-up after runner-backed E2E rerun — 2026-10-23

- CI on `ce39f9a6d6a48aa2be96fc86d2f5ce812db5ae4e`: Verify passed; ACE JAMB E2E failed after typecheck/build/browser setup. The refreshed Playwright artifact confirms the admin readiness test no longer fails; the remaining failure is the first-use Account Settings regression in desktop/mobile.
- Trace evidence shows the gate intentionally routes a student to onboarding when `student_preferences.daily_minutes` is absent. The previous test returned a missing-preferences response to the gate itself, so its expectation of the dashboard was invalid. Updated the test fixture so the gate receives a complete preference record first, then the Account Settings component receives an empty representation to exercise its own missing-row fallback and authenticated upsert path. This is test-only; no app/backend behavior or production data was changed in this adjustment.
- Fix commit: `1763de8ad72a2c486907a7643ea3865fdbd5a0ea` (`test: isolate missing preferences to account settings screen`).
- Verification: the new Verify run `#706` and E2E run `#639` were still QUEUED when checked; the rerun is therefore not yet verified. The prior current-main run did verify typecheck/build but E2E remained failed on the now-corrected fixture. Do not mark Phase 2 complete.
- Exact next action: poll Verify `#706` and ACE JAMB E2E `#639` for commit `1763de8`; inspect any new Playwright artifacts, fix only reproducible failures, and rerun on the latest source. Then complete deployed student/admin/mobile acceptance if supported. Phase 2 remains OPEN.


## Frontend E2E fixes verified — 2026-10-23

- Latest source-fix commit under test: `1763de8ad72a2c486907a7643ea3865fdbd5a0ea`. The admin readiness test waits for metric queries and exposes the mocked `content-range` header; unknown knowledge-source readiness explicitly keeps student AI disabled. The first-use settings regression keeps the onboarding gate's preferences complete, then simulates a missing row specifically when Account Settings loads.
- GitHub Actions **Verify #706** (run `39963740781`) completed successfully on `1763de8`: Node contract tests, Deno checks for both catalogue functions, `npm run typecheck`, `npm run build`, and both disposable PostgreSQL migration/policy tests passed.
- GitHub Actions **ACE JAMB E2E #639** (run `39963740632`) completed successfully on `1763de8`: typecheck, build, browser installation, and Playwright all passed; both prior repeated failures no longer reproduce. The job status and each step were re-read and confirmed successful.
- These are mocked-contract browser tests, not proof of production content availability or live payment/referral/AI/audio/notification services. No production deployment, database writes, schema changes, or migrations were performed. The earlier build chunk-size warning and npm audit findings remain unresolved.
- **Phase 2 remains OPEN** pending the remaining documented acceptance review, including existing deployed student/admin/mobile navigation and PWA behavior. Do not claim whole-product frontend completion from this CI pass alone.
- Exact next action: perform read-only acceptance of the existing frontend routes and PWA shell (student dashboard/navigation/settings, admin authorization and academic route, narrow mobile layout, service-worker cache exclusions) without deploying or changing backend state; fix only reproducible defects and update the acceptance matrix before deciding whether Phase 2 can close.


## Read-only frontend acceptance review — 2026-10-23

- Re-read `public/sw.js`: same-origin GET-only; excludes auth, REST, functions, storage, realtime, API and worker-script paths; network-first navigation falls back only to the static app shell; only Vite `/assets/` files are cached. No account/payment/CBT response data is cached.
- `playwright.config.ts` confirms Desktop Chrome and Pixel 5/mobile Chromium. Verify #706 and ACE JAMB E2E #639 passed on source-fix commit `1763de8`.
- Repository search did not find a configured Cloudflare Pages, Vercel or Netlify frontend URL. Because app deployment remains explicitly out of scope, deployed-browser acceptance is BLOCKED/UNVERIFIED until an already-existing approved URL is available; no deployment was attempted.
- No new source defect established. Whole-product frontend completion remains open; live provider-dependent delivery/payment/referral/AI/audio/notification behavior and production content availability are not proven by mocked CI.
- Next action: continue the remaining frontend acceptance matrix using source and CI evidence; perform live browser acceptance only if an existing approved URL is documented/provided. Do not deploy or change backend state.


## Academic editor authorization error hardening — 2026-10-23

- Read-only review found `AcademicFoundationGate` rendered caught authorization/RPC errors using `caught.message`, unlike the admin gate's generic safe error. Changed it to show only “Unable to verify academic editor access. Please try again.”
- Added a Playwright regression test that mocks a 500 response containing synthetic database details and asserts those details and the raw error code are not rendered. All Supabase calls remain intercepted; no production data is used.
- Commits: `178709e5059fe4fb31b79480315dac628228caeb` (frontend fix), `adaec568f7b678ca3c911cccf65ca1d4f02cf247` (regression test).
- Verification: Verify workflow #719 / run `39964865822` **PASS** (Node tests, Deno checks, typecheck, build, and disposable PostgreSQL policy/migration tests). ACE JAMB E2E #652 / run `39964865810` **PASS**: 64 Playwright tests passed, 0 failed; typecheck, build and browser installation also passed.
- No backend, database, migration, production data, workflow, or deployment changes. App deployment remains explicitly out of scope. Existing build chunk-size warning and npm audit findings remain unresolved.
- Phase 2 remains **OPEN** pending reconciliation of remaining acceptance items; latest Verify/E2E evidence is recorded below. Exact next action: review the remaining source-based frontend acceptance matrix, mark items covered/blocked/unverified, and do not deploy or change backend state.


## Latest academic authorization hardening verification — 2026-10-23

- **Current tested source/test commit:** `adaec568f7b678ca3c911cccf65ca1d4f02cf247`. Later commits in the current history are documentation-only; no source/test change followed this tested SHA.
- **Verify #719**, run `39964865822`: **PASS**. Node contract tests, Deno checks, typecheck, production build, and disposable PostgreSQL policy/migration checks completed successfully.
- **ACE JAMB E2E #652**, run `39964865810`: **PASS**. GitHub Actions run page reports 64 Playwright tests passed in 37.0 seconds, 0 failed; job duration 7m57s. Typecheck, build and browser installation also passed. This suite runs Desktop Chrome and Pixel 5/mobile Chromium per `playwright.config.ts`.
- The newly added academic authorization error privacy regression is included in this successful Playwright run. No backend/database, production data, migration, deployment, or workflow changes were made as part of this frontend work.
- **Evidence correction:** an earlier historical entry in `FRONTEND-COMPLETION-BATCH-2026-10-21.md` says the Playwright artifact's `error-context.md` and trace network snapshots were inspected. That inspection is not supported by the actual tool record for that investigation; the artifact was retrieved but those contents were not verified. Do not rely on that specific claim. The runner's successful test summary above was independently checked on the GitHub Actions run page.
- Remaining limitations: no existing approved deployed frontend URL has been established, so live deployed-browser acceptance is blocked/unverified while app deployment remains explicitly out of scope. Live provider-dependent payment/referral/AI/audio/notification behavior and production content availability are not proven by mocked CI. Build chunk-size warning and previously reported npm audit findings remain open.
- **Milestone status:** frontend Phase 2 has clean runner-backed CI, but whole-product frontend acceptance remains **OPEN** until the documented acceptance matrix is reconciled. Next action: inspect the remaining source-based acceptance matrix for uncovered routes/behaviors, record each as covered, blocked, or unverified, and do not deploy or touch backend state.


## Active admin catalogue UI retirement — 2026-10-23

- The active administrator dashboard was still rendering the legacy catalogue import, single-row catalogue staging, and IBASS catalogue staging components, despite the project direction that ACE JAMB is no longer using the catalogue and work is frontend-only. Removed those three components from `AdminFoundationGate` and updated the admin intro copy to focus on operations and academic structure.
- Added E2E assertions that the active admin dashboard does not render the retired “Admin Catalogue Import”, “Single-row review-only staging”, or “Stage programmes & UTME requirements” workflows.
- Commits: `0eb373ae1393bfab0dbae8edf856f9617a698e72` (active admin UI) and `6c3201ba83d90ab384dae53b6faf724d0d8da8ab` (regression assertions).
- This is a frontend-only visibility change. It does not delete backend functions, database objects, catalogue component source files, or data; no backend/DB/deployment changes were made. The legacy `/admin-import` path still resolves to the admin gate, but the retired catalogue workflows are no longer rendered there.
- Latest source/test commit `85a4b5b` is also verified: Verify #740 / run `39967022806` **PASS** and ACE JAMB E2E #673 / run `39967023111` **PASS** (64 Playwright tests passed, 0 failed).
- **Next action:** reconcile the remaining frontend acceptance matrix, recording each item as covered, blocked, or unverified. Phase 2 remains OPEN pending remaining frontend acceptance-matrix reconciliation; deployment remains out of scope.


## Retired catalogue UI change — CI verified — 2026-10-23

- Tested source/test commit: `6c3201ba83d90ab384dae53b6faf724d0d8da8ab` (active admin catalogue UI retirement and E2E assertions).
- Verify #729 / run `39966265866`: **PASS**. Both `verify` and disposable PostgreSQL `utme-subject-choice-migration` jobs succeeded; Node tests, Deno checks, typecheck, build, and disposable policy/migration checks all passed.
- ACE JAMB E2E #662 / run `39966266064`: **PASS**. The Playwright job completed successfully with **64 passed, 0 failed** in 40.5 seconds. Typecheck, build, browser installation, and browser tests all passed across the configured desktop and mobile projects.
- The active admin dashboard no longer renders the retired catalogue import, single-row staging, or IBASS staging workflows. This is only a frontend visibility change; underlying legacy component files/backend functions/database objects were not deleted or changed.
- No deployment or production/backend/database change was made. Build chunk-size warning and previous npm audit findings remain unresolved. Live deployed-browser acceptance and live provider integrations remain unverified because app deployment is out of scope.
- **Next action:** continue reconciling the remaining frontend acceptance matrix from existing source and CI evidence; mark each item covered, blocked, or unverified. Phase 2 remains OPEN until the remaining acceptance criteria are reconciled; do not deploy or touch backend state.


## Legacy catalogue entrypoint removal — 2026-10-23

- Further source review found the old standalone `admin-import.html` and `src/admin-import.tsx` still presented a catalogue import page even after the active admin dashboard had stopped rendering the catalogue workflows. Deleted both stale entrypoint files.
- Added a Playwright assertion that the legacy `/admin-import` URL resolves to the normal authorized admin dashboard and never renders catalogue or IBASS staging UI. The active route alias is intentionally retained for compatibility; it no longer exposes the retired importer.
- Commits: `d9b4e576bc3fc5802cc30ed786e37aeea59e23cf` (remove HTML entrypoint), `df44ebea2a27cbb62f2327ef45fd4177bc5b94a8` (remove TSX entrypoint), `85a4b5b1aed59b8d5bfb3e7c09de53d873cdb9af` (E2E route guard).
- Latest CI for this change is verified: Verify #740 / run `39967022806` PASS and ACE JAMB E2E #673 / run `39967023111` PASS (64 Playwright tests passed, 0 failed).
- Scope remains frontend-only: no backend functions, database objects/data, migration, workflow, or deployment changes. Unused catalogue component sources and contract tests remain in the repository to avoid deleting backend-adjacent safety coverage; they are no longer rendered or reachable from the active UI.
- Next action: verify both workflows for `85a4b5b1aed59b8d5bfb3e7c09de53d873cdb9af`, then reconcile the remaining frontend acceptance list. Do not deploy or touch backend/database state.


## Whole-product frontend acceptance matrix — evidence snapshot 2026-10-23

This matrix separates what automated mocked-contract CI proves from live/data/provider behavior that remains unavailable or unverified. It is not a declaration that the whole frontend is complete.

| Area | Status | Evidence / remaining boundary |
|---|---|---|
| Sign-up/sign-in/recovery, session restore, onboarding and profile save | **Covered by E2E contracts** | Playwright covers account recovery, student entry, first-use onboarding, persistence and error recovery on desktop/mobile. Live email delivery and production-account acceptance are not established by these mocked tests. |
| Community/channel welcome | **UI covered; membership verification blocked** | Onboarding-to-community flow and the user-supplied official WhatsApp channel URL are tested. A CTA is not membership verification; no server-verifiable membership/group mapping contract is established. |
| Dashboard/navigation/account settings | **Covered by E2E contracts** | Workspace URL/history, reload persistence, account settings and first-use missing-preferences path are covered. Real student records are not part of the mocked suite. |
| Learning/syllabus/revision | **Partial; content-dependent** | Published/pending syllabus visibility and honest empty states are tested. Last recorded live audit (2026-10-21) showed 0 topics/subtopics; recheck live data before claiming content availability. |
| Practice/CBT | **Flow contracts covered; production content blocked** | E2E covers start, resume, answer persistence, expiry/retry and saved result recovery. Last recorded live audit showed 0 published questions and 0 attempts; no official question data may be invented. |
| Flashcards/progress/adaptive recommendations | **Partial / data-dependent** | Honest no-deck/no-performance states exist. Last recorded live audit showed 0 flashcards and 0 learning-progress rows. Substantive content-driven behavior is unverified until reviewed content and real attempts exist. |
| Study plan | **Preferences covered; adaptive plan unverified** | Preferences load/save and error handling are covered. Live study plan/item data was empty in the last recorded audit; adaptive recommendations are not proven. |
| Notifications | **Inbox/preferences UI covered; delivery blocked/unverified** | Student-scoped inbox/read-state and preferences have E2E coverage. No delivery worker/scheduling/push integration was evidenced by the last source/schema audit. |
| ACE Pass/payments/referrals | **Read-only status UI; transactions/qualification blocked** | Account surfaces read self-scoped rows and show honest empty states. No client-side payment, entitlement, referral qualification or reward writes; provider/webhook verification is not established in the frontend-only scope. |
| Grounded AI/audio | **Safely unavailable; provider/content contracts missing** | UI does not claim tutor/audio readiness when sources/providers are absent. Last audit showed 0 knowledge sources/chunks and no dedicated AI request or audio delivery service. |
| Admin/academic | **Authorization and basic operations covered; full command center partial** | Admin/academic access, safe generic error handling, read-only readiness counts and academic authoring routes have E2E coverage. Legacy catalogue import UI and standalone entrypoint were retired; no backend/catalogue objects were deleted. Broader moderation, monetization and delivery operations remain incomplete. |
| PWA/offline/cache | **Static-shell contract covered** | Playwright checks manifest/service-worker behavior; source excludes auth/API/storage/CBT-sensitive requests from cache. Real-device install/offline behavior remains unverified. |
| Accessibility/performance | **Partial** | Desktop and Pixel 5 Playwright projects pass on prior source commit. A dedicated manual keyboard/screen-reader/low-end Android audit is not recorded. Build still emits the ~916 kB chunk warning; prior npm audit reported 8 vulnerabilities (2 moderate, 6 high). |
| Live deployed browser | **Blocked by user scope** | No approved existing deployment URL is established; user explicitly prohibited app deployment. No deployment attempted. |

### Current verification boundary
- Latest tested source/test commit: `85a4b5b1aed59b8d5bfb3e7c09de53d873cdb9af`.
- Verify #740 / run `39967022806`: **PASS**.
- ACE JAMB E2E #673 / run `39967023111`: **IN PROGRESS** at the time of this matrix update; typecheck/build passed and browser installation was still running. Do not claim the latest route assertion passed until E2E finishes.
- Prior commit `6c3201ba83d90ab384dae53b6faf724d0d8da8ab` passed Verify #729 and E2E #662 (64 passed, 0 failed), but predates removal of the standalone HTML/TSX entrypoint and the added `/admin-import` route guard.

### Next action
Poll E2E #673 and record its final result. Then prioritize only frontend work supportable by existing real contracts/content; do not invent official content or implement fake provider flows. Phase 2 remains OPEN until this matrix's blocked/partial areas are either completed safely or explicitly accepted as external/backend dependencies. Deployment and backend work remain out of scope.


## Legacy importer retirement — CI result and deployment audit — 2026-10-23

- Tested source/test commit `85a4b5b1aed59b8d5bfb3e7c09de53d873cdb9af` passed **Verify #740 / run `39967022806`** and **ACE JAMB E2E #673 / run `39967023111`**.
- E2E job logs were fetched after completion: **64 Playwright tests passed in 44.4 seconds, 0 failed**. Typecheck, build, browser installation and browser tests all completed successfully. The new assertions confirm the retired catalogue UI is absent from `/admin` and `/admin-import` resolves only to the normal authorized admin dashboard.
- Read-only path checks on current main returned 404 for `.github/workflows/deploy-production.yml`, `wrangler.jsonc`, `backend/index.ts`, and `src/App.tsx`; `package.json` has no deploy script and `src/vite-env.d.ts` has no AppDeploy shim. This confirms the deployment workflow/config and legacy entrypoint are absent from the current branch. Historical deployment references in old handoff notes are archival; do not recreate deployment assets.
- Updated `README.md` to reflect Phase 1's verified mocked-contract closure, the still-open integrated whole-product frontend batch, the retired importer route, and the explicit no-deploy boundary. README and handoff changes after `85a4b5b` are documentation-only; the tested application source did not change.
- No backend, database, production data, migration, or deployment changes were made. Phase 2 remains OPEN: content-driven learning/practice/flashcards/progress, provider-dependent payment/referral/AI/audio/push delivery, full admin operations and live deployed acceptance are blocked or unverified under current scope. See the acceptance matrix above.
- **Next action:** continue only with frontend improvements supported by existing verified content/contracts; otherwise record the exact backend/content dependency and leave the feature honestly unavailable. Do not deploy or touch backend/database state.
