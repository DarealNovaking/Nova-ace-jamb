# Frontend Phase 3 — Current Handoff (2026-10-23)

## Current status
**IN PROGRESS — first accessibility slice committed; CI verification pending.**

## Canonical project and scope
- Repository: `DarealNovaking/Nova-ace-jamb`
- Branch: `main`
- Current source/test commit: `667085dea853f4c30ed9b639259ab593304305ed` (corrected E2E fixture; CI pending). Documentation commits continue after this source/test commit.
- Phase 2 is closed for the authorized frontend-only scope; Phase 3 now owns the carried-forward frontend-auditable work.
- User boundary: frontend only. Do not deploy, alter backend/database/production data, restore catalogue UI, or invent JAMB content/provider results.

## First implementation slice
- `src/components/StudentDashboard.tsx`: initial loading main landmark now has `id="main-content"` and `aria-busy="true"`; loading text is exposed through polite atomic `role="status"`; decorative spinner is hidden from assistive technology. Home dashboard main landmark also uses `id="main-content"`.
- `tests/e2e/smoke.spec.ts`: added deterministic test that delays the mocked profile response, asserts the loading announcement, releases the response, and confirms the prepared dashboard renders.
- Source commit: [a506726](https://github.com/DarealNovaking/Nova-ace-jamb/commit/a50672679b4e70a307e52ed86f29c015e1f01574)
- Test commit: [90459bc](https://github.com/DarealNovaking/Nova-ace-jamb/commit/90459bc9eb64ad17f1f4df125cdc9449f48ded5b)

## Verification
- The last verified source/test snapshot before Phase 3 was `85a4b5b1aed59b8d5bfb3e7c09de53d873cdb9af`: Verify #740 PASS and E2E #673 PASS (64 Playwright tests, 0 failures).
- The new Phase 3 commits are **not covered** by those old results. E2E #694 passed for source commit `a506726`; E2E #695 failed for test commit `90459bc` because the test delayed `profiles` before the student gate mounted the dashboard. The test now delays dashboard-only RPC `get_active_exam_blueprint` in commit `667085d`.
- E2E #694 passed but is E2E-only; E2E #695 failed due to the test fixture described above. The corrected commit `667085d` awaits E2E. Typecheck/build for the new Phase 3 slice remain **PENDING/UNVERIFIED** because these E2E workflow runs have no dedicated jobs for them.
- Tests continue to use mocked Supabase contracts; they do not establish live content/provider behavior.

## Remaining Phase 3 priorities
1. Check CI for the source/test commits; diagnose any actual failures and rerun on current source.
2. Audit student workspace, CBT controls, forms, async states, keyboard focus and semantic landmarks. Add targeted regression coverage for each confirmed gap.
3. Measure the Vite chunk composition before deciding on a bundle optimization; prior build warning was approximately 916 kB minified. Avoid speculative rewrites.
4. Continue admin UX only where existing verified contracts support it.
5. Keep missing published content and missing payment/referral/AI/audio/notification delivery contracts honestly unavailable.
6. Manual keyboard/screen-reader review, real-device PWA/offline and low-end Android checks remain unverified. Live deployed-browser acceptance is out of scope because deployment is prohibited.

## Known debt carried forward
- Prior npm audit reported 8 vulnerabilities (2 moderate, 6 high); not remediated in this slice.
- Existing approximately 916 kB Vite chunk warning; not optimized in this slice.
- No backend/database/deployment/catalogue changes made.

## Exact next action
Inspect GitHub Actions for corrected test commit `667085dea853f4c30ed9b639259ab593304305ed`; verify the test on desktop and mobile, then confirm typecheck/build using the existing Verify workflow if available. Do not deploy. Continue the keyboard/semantic audit only after this test is green.


## Phase 3 accessibility-test failure and fixture correction — 2026-10-23

- E2E run [#694 / 39972910693](https://github.com/DarealNovaking/Nova-ace-jamb/actions/runs/39972910693) for source commit `a50672679b4e70a307e52ed86f29c015e1f01574` **PASS**. This was an E2E-only workflow; it did not run separate typecheck/build jobs.
- E2E run [#695 / 39972935144](https://github.com/DarealNovaking/Nova-ace-jamb/actions/runs/39972935144) for test commit `90459bc9eb64ad17f1f4df125cdc9449f48ded5b` **FAIL**: 2 of 4 browser variants could not find the expected dashboard loading status.
- Root cause in the new test fixture: it delayed the `profiles` request, which the student foundation gate itself needs before mounting the dashboard. Therefore the dashboard loading status could not appear. This was a test synchronization mistake, not evidence of a production dashboard defect.
- Correction committed as `667085dea853f4c30ed9b639259ab593304305ed`: delay the dashboard-only `get_active_exam_blueprint` RPC instead, allowing the auth/onboarding gate to complete before asserting the dashboard's announced loading state. The delayed request still falls back to the existing mocked response; all Supabase traffic remains intercepted.
- **Verification after correction: pending.** Do not claim the regression test passes until a new E2E run on commit `667085dea853f4c30ed9b639259ab593304305ed` completes. This E2E workflow does not include dedicated typecheck/build jobs.
- Exact next action: inspect the new CI run, confirm the targeted test and both desktop/mobile projects pass, then run/confirm typecheck and build via the repository's Verify workflow if available. No backend/database/deployment changes.
